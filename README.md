**DEVPOST DESCRIPTION**
## Inspiration
Our group members tried to get onto a skincare regiment but had no idea where to start. One of our friends knew all the pros and cons of different products and we knew what we wanted. So we put that together to make Lumen Generator
## What it does
Lumen Generator prompts the user to select their preferences, goals, and what they want to acheive with these products. It also asks users what allergies they have or things they want to avoid in the products the page reccomends. With these inputs, Lumen then compares the wants and avoids on a weighted basis to an exisiting curation of top products and then reccomends the top (up to 5) products for the user to try
## How we built it
We wanted a challenge and built this entirely using HTML, CSS, and JS. No framework at all. We started by compiling the curation of the products, then creating the user interfaces, and finally doing the comparison and reccomendation.
## Challenges we ran into
HTML is inherently a static language, and we want to make it move using JS. This posed many problems for us and we had to really think about what each line of code does as well as where it is placed inside of elemnts like the header and body.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This is out first hackathon, and we actually finished and got a working product!
## What we learned
We learnt how lucky we are to have front end framworks like React. We learnt a lot about JS and how it works with HTML.
## What's next for truly-humble-under-git Lumen Generator
The first thing we want to add next is so that when a user clicks the reccomendation card, it will flip over and have links to the product on major distributor websites. After that we want to expand the curated list and integrate it with GPT so that GPT can continusly populate and assign biases and weightings to the list of options. And after that we want to make it more user-centric where the user can select not just which specifc desires and despises they have, but also how important each one is to them and essesntially give it a front-end bias.
